      desc1: 'We believe in the responsible use of antibiotics important to human medicine* to help preserve their effectiveness for human and animal health in the future. Our policies do not permit the routine use of medically important antibiotics for the purpose of growth promotion or the habitual use of antibiotics for disease prevention. \n\nOur focus is on refining antibiotic selection and administration, reducing non-therapeutic antibiotic use and, when possible, replacing antibiotics with long-term solutions to proactively prevent disease and protect animal health and welfare. We remain committed to the treatment of sick animals aligned with herd veterinarian direction to ensure the safety of our supply chain. \n\nIn August of 2016, we accomplished our goal to only source chickens in the U.S. not treated with antibiotics important to human medicine. Building on this progress, the use of Highest Priority Critically Important Antibiotics (HPCIAs) to human medicine has been eliminated from all chicken served in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Japan, South Korea and the U.S., with China expected to comply before the end of 2027. \n\nWe didn’t stop there. In December 2018, McDonald’s announced a policy to reduce the overall use of antibiotics important to human health, in our beef supply chain. Our policy covers 10 in-scope beef sourcing markets around the world, including the U.S., representing more than 85% of our global beef supply. \n\nFor more information on our approach to individual protein supply chains, visit Advocating for Responsible Antibiotic Use in Beef,  Implementing a Global Chicken Antibiotics Policy, and Our Pork Antibiotics Use Policy.',

This is achieved in one of two ways: coffee is sourced as certified to international sustainability standards through organizations such as Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade International and Fair Trade USA, or coffee is sourced from farms participating in approved roaster-led programs that comply with the McCafé SIP program. These two approaches are complementary efforts and McDonald’s will continue to support both certification and direct engagement with farmers as methods to achieve positive impacts. \n\nTo meet our commitment to support a deforestation-free supply chain, coffee sourced in high-risk countries for deforestation must be Rainforest Alliance certified.

      title1: 'Pork Sow Housing',
      desc1: 'As of the end of 2022, more than 91% of our pork purchased in the U.S. comes from suppliers that have phased out the use of gestation stalls for housing confirmed pregnant sows. This marks continued significant progress on our journey to maximize the time that pregnant sows spend in a group environment. Our commitment is guided by the industry- and American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV)-endorsed definition for group housing for pregnant sows. McDonald’s currently buys nearly 175 million pounds of pork associated with producers that house pregnant sows in groups. \n\nSince announcing the commitment in 2012, McDonald’s and our supplier partners have worked diligently to meet this goal and remain dedicated to achieving it, engaging with industry-wide stakeholders to share our vision with an ongoing focus on driving progress at scale. In 2017, we reached a milestone to source pork for the U.S. business only from producers who share our commitment. \n\nWhile McDonald’s targeted the end of 2022 for completion, industry-wide challenges for farmers and pork producers – such as the impacts from global outbreaks of African Swine Fever and the COVID-19 pandemic – delayed progress and interrupted business. By the end of 2022, our adjusted expectation was that 85–90% of our U.S. pork volumes would be sourced by suppliers from producers in conformity with our commitment, representing material progress against our original 10-year timeframe. We have since surpassed that expectation, reaching 91% as of the end of 2022. \n\nPhasing out the use of gestation stalls for the purpose of housing pregnant sows in the U.S. is a goal that remains vital to McDonald’s business and builds on our decades-long commitment to animal health and welfare. We remain committed to this journey, and we are on track to achieve our U.S. target by the end of 2024.',

To achieve this, we outlined eight Broiler Welfare Commitments in 13 of our key markets1, which are expected to be fully implemented by the end of 2024. The in-scope markets represented more than 58% of our global chicken supply as of the end of 2022. \n\nOur eight commitments to broiler welfare include: \n\n1. Establishing and convening the McDonald’s Chicken Sustainability Advisory Council (CSAC). \n2. Measuring key farm-level welfare outcomes. \n3. Developing state-of-the-art welfare measurement technology. \n4. Providing enrichments to support natural behavior. \n5. Running commercial trials to study the effects of certain production parameters on welfare outcomes. \n6. Utilizing Controlled Atmospheric Stunning (CAS) in the U.S. and Canada. \n7. Implementing third-party, on-farm auditing. \n8. Completing an assessment to measure the feasibility of extending these commitments to additional global markets where McDonald’s operates. ',
